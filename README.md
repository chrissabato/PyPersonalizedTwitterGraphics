# PyPersonalizedTwitterGraphics

This is a semi automated Twitter graphic reply generator. The intended purpose is to post a tweet of a personalized jersey graphic asking users to reply with details if they want one. If a user replies to the tweet in the format number, name (00, Smith), this software can extract that info, generate a custom graphic and reply with the graphic.
